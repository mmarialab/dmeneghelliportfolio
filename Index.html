        <h2>Lighting Design</h2>
        <p> Daniela is a graduated architect master in lighting design with seven
            years experience in this field. Her interest in lighting started as an
            architecture student in Brazil, where daylight was always a guideline to
            her projects.
            Working for the most established lighting practices in London and Rio
            de Janeiro, she has delivered prestigious projects worldwide.
            With her diligent work and ability to coordinate projects of different
            types and scales, Daniela became a skilled lighting designer with
            expertise in high end residential, hospitality, art collection, and
            commercial projects.
            Her traveller and creative nature combined with sensibility and
            technical knowledge reveal the ability to make every project unique,
            bringing the magic of light no matter where. </p>
